For database i used docker container

# Docker Configuration

Below is the Docker Compose configuration for setting up the MySQL service:

```yaml
services:
    mysql:
        # MySQL service configuration...
        volumes:
            - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql
        # Additional configuration...

volumes:
    mysql_data:
        # Configuration for persistent MySQL data volume
```

The volumes directive in your Docker Compose YAML file, specifically the line - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql, is used for managing persistent data for Docker containers. Let's break it down for better understanding:

Understanding Docker Volumes
In Docker, a volume is a persistent data storage mechanism that allows you to keep data even after the container is stopped or deleted. This is crucial for databases, as you don't want to lose your data every time you restart the container.

Components of the Volume Directive
mysql_data: This is the name of the volume. It's a reference to a volume that Docker will manage. If this volume doesn't exist, Docker will create it the first time you run the container.

:/var/lib/mysql: This is the path inside the container where the volume is mounted. For the MySQL container, /var/lib/mysql is the directory where MySQL stores its data files.

What Happens Behind the Scenes
When you start the container, Docker checks if a volume named mysql_data exists.
If it doesn't exist, Docker creates this volume in the Docker host's file system.
Docker then mounts this volume to /var/lib/mysql inside the mysql container.
Any data that the MySQL service writes to /var/lib/mysql is actually written to the mysql_data volume. This means the data persists independently of the container's lifecycle.
Benefits of Using Volumes
Data Persistence: Even if you delete the container, the data in the volume remains intact. You can create a new container and reattach the same volume to continue using the data.
Data Sharing and Portability: Volumes can be shared between multiple containers, and they're independent of the container's file system, making your setup more flexible and portable.
Performance: Volumes are managed by Docker and can offer better performance for database storage compared to bind mounts or storing data in the container's writable layer.
Usage in Development
In your development environment, this setup ensures that your database data remains persistent across container restarts or rebuilds. It's an essential practice for maintaining stateful data like databases in Docker.
